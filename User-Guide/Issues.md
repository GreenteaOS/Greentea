### Feedback and discussion

#### Finding and reading messages

* Go to <https://github.com/GreenteaOS/Greentea/issues>
* Green indicator means the actual message
* Red indicator - closed, irrelevant discussion or already fixed bug: <https://github.com/GreenteaOS/Greentea/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed> link to all completed discussions
* The search field is located directly under the **Issues** tab (not to be confused with the *This repository* box at the top of the screen)

To leave a comment you need to have a GitHub account: <https://github.com/join>

You can insert pictures! Drag the image file to the input field or paste it from the clipboard using the *Ctrl + V* keyboard shortcut.

To mention the developer, use the `@` character, for example [@torvalds](https://github.com/torvalds)

To preview, click **Preview** (and then click **Write** to return from the preview mode).

#### How do I leave feedback or a new error message?

* Go to <https://github.com/GreenteaOS/Greentea/issues>
* Make sure, through the search, that there is no similiar issue: type the text in the search field directly under the **Issues** tab
* Create issue by clicking the **New issue** button or by following the link <https://github.com/GreenteaOS/Greentea/issues/new>

#### How to add emotion and vote for comment

* Add emotion to any comment: <br>![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3642643/23592706/1ecbadb2-0216-11e7-9c23-14a9cfb04c3f.png)
* Vote for an emotion or add one more: <br> [image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3642643/23592726/6016b8ca-0216-11e7-947a-76973bb7d1e0.png)

The meaning of emotions should be interpreted accordingly as:
* "like/agree/makes sense"
* "dislike/disagree/against"
* "funny joke!"
* "hurray!/finally!"
* "hmmm/eh/gee/sorry/nothing is clear/okay/have to think"
* "I really like/I really hope/the best comment"

#### How to comment on the commits

Commit is a small update of the source code with a description to it. Usually commits are self-sufficient, for example: "Updated the icon", "Renamed the shutdown button of the computer". Large updates can consist of a group of commits going in turn.

In accordance with international standards - commits are conducted in English, as well as comments to them.

Click on the commit hash, for example [e1b5d02](https://github.com/GreenteaOS/Greentea/commit/e1b5d027a6913e0e4bbb6ecbbf62153cbb99ddc2) or `e1b5d027a6913e0e4bbb6ecbbf62153cbb99ddc2`, this will open the commit view page. Now you can leave a comment or start a discussion by clicking the `[+]` icon next to the desired line:
