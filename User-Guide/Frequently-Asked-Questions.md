#### What is Greentea OS, shortly?

It is a next-generation free operating system able to run your Windows programs.

#### Is Greentea OS an operating system, distro, visual theme or app?

Similiar to macOS and Windows, Greentea is a full operating system, installable on a PC. It runs apps, games and has some built-in software.
It is **not** based on any other system.

#### Is Greentea OS Ad-driven or funded by corporations?

Nope. Greentea is funded solely by [donations](https://greenteaos.github.io/donate/).

#### Is Greentea OS a GNU/Linux distro?

No. It is an independent OS, without Linux kernel.

#### What makes Greentea OS so unique OS?

**From developer perspective:** runtimes-based OS, aimed at strict isolation, it has no API to itself from user space.
To achieve those goals, we created new kernel for it - Tofita.

**From user perspective:** apps cannot break the system or make it slow. System updates are fast and not annoying. 

Being internally very different from common ones, 
this system is friendly and does not push "innovations" at you face, thus making you feel at home.

#### What is Tofita?

[Tofita](https://github.com/GreenteaOS/Tofita) is *the* Greentea OS kernel, the core, the heart of the system.

#### Where I may download it?

We don't provide public builds yet, only for developers and testers.

#### How can I test it?

Check our [Telegram group](https://t.me/greenteaos).

#### As Microsoft bought GitHub, is it safe to host this project there?

Yes. Git is a system, on which GitHub is based, used to store and operate on project's source code.

Git is **distrubuted**, **decentralized** and **consistent**. It is **not** possible to silently edit or fake code.

There is no reason to worry about.
