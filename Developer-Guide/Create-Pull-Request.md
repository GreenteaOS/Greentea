## How to contribute a Pull Request (PR or patch)

### Use pre-defined templates

When you create new PR, GitHub proposes a template (constructed by our team). Please fill all required marks and check boxes. Most (if not all) Greentea repos provide those templates.

### Try to not move or rename files and folders

This breaks existing PRs from other contributors and mostly unnecessary.
